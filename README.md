# Percolation

Percolation solution for Algs4 Part 1 Class on Coursera.

Gets 95% score, fails on memory tests because I use two UF objects to solve the backwash issue. 

Percolation.zip(backwash) scores 92.5%, passing memory tests but fails on Correctness due to backwash. 

Leaving it at 95%, to move on to next assignments
